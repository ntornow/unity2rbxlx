## Pipeline / runtime gaps

- [ ] **P3 — Optional component-aware autogen injection.** The
  remaining piece of the original FPS-extraction P1: replace the
  heuristic-based ``detect_fps_game`` with component-aware injection.
  e.g. emit a Cinemachine bridge only when the scene actually has a
  CinemachineVirtualCamera, not when the script heuristic matches.
  Currently the detector still runs as a soft hint when
  ``--scaffolding=fps`` is not passed.

  Earlier phases of this work shipped:
  - PR #66: generalized ``script_coherence_packs.py``.
  - PR #1 (#68): made FPS scaffolding opt-in via ``--scaffolding=fps``.
  - PR #2: split ``fps_client_generator.py`` into
    ``converter/scaffolding/fps.py`` (FPS-specific) and
    ``converter/autogen.py`` (generic autogen scripts). The
    transitional re-export shim was deleted once all internal
    callers had migrated.

  Earlier cleanup landed:
  - PR #3: extracted ``connectClient`` into
    ``runtime/event_dispatch.luau`` (auto-injected when
    ``--scaffolding=fps`` opts in). HUDController now requires the
    shared module instead of inlining the BindableEvent vs
    RemoteEvent fork.


- [ ] **P2 — Persistent prefab/asset cache.** Prefab library is in-memory
  only; rebuilt from disk every conversion. Needs a cache-schema design
  pass before code — see
  [`docs/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](docs/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
  § "Persistent prefab/asset cache".

## Materials & meshes

- [ ] **P2 — Full SurfaceAppearance round-trip through templates.** PR 5
  deferred. The smoke ran with `--no-upload` so real asset IDs never wired
  through `ReplicatedStorage.Templates`. Verify on a full upload run.
## Infrastructure

- [ ] **P2 — Three-flow byte-equivalence: u2r.py vs convert_interactive.py
  divergence (Phase 5.1 follow-up).** The byte-equivalence test landed
  with `test_three_flows_produce_identical_rbxlx` xfailed because the
  in-memory u2r.py path inlines scripts via `_convert_prefab_node` while
  the cross-process interactive path goes through `rehydration_plan.py`,
  producing different sets of Script Items. Harmonize the two paths so
  the test flips from xfail to xpass.
- [ ] **P2 — Standalone `.rbxm` file output per prefab.** PR 5 deferred.
  Toolbox convenience; no runtime dependency. Design notes in
  [`docs/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](docs/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
  § "Standalone `.rbxm` per-prefab output".
- [ ] **P2 — Visual-compare baseline screenshot (Phase 5.4 follow-up).**
  CI step is wired, gated on `eval_baseline_screenshots/SimpleFPS_main.png`
  existing. Commit a known-good baseline from the next clean smoke run
  to activate the SSIM 0.85 gate; until then the step warns and continues.
- [ ] **P2 — Real-upload smoke secrets (Phase 5.2b / 5.3 follow-up).**
  CI jobs `real-upload-smoke` and `ai-convert-matrix` skip cleanly until
  their repo secrets are configured: `real-upload-smoke` needs
  `ROBLOX_API_KEY`, `ROBLOX_UNIVERSE_ID`, `ROBLOX_PLACE_ID`, and
  `ROBLOX_CREATOR_ID`; `ai-convert-matrix` needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
  Wire them when CI billing allows.
## Type-strictness debt (forward-only gate landed; cleanup separate)

The no-Any gate prevents new smuggling. Existing-offender cleanup has
landed in dedicated PRs (#10 gate, storage_plan, ported-module signatures
PR #34, PipelineState PR #36, trivial 3-fix + ConversionContext final 4).

No tracked remaining items. The `scene_converter.py` `mesh_hierarchies`
field that previously lived here is already typed
`dict[str, list[MeshHierarchyEntry]]` (see `scene_converter.py:177`).
